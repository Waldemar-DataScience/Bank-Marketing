# Portfolio Project 3 - Classification

## Bank Marketing

### General Overview
The business aim of the project is to increase efficiency of bank marketing campaign offering a bank deposit to the clients.
We took historic data describing results of previous campaigns and create a Machine Learning binary classification model. The model predicts if the client is likely to accept the bank deposit offer. Such a model can reduce the cost of marketing campaign - we can more efficiently choose the client to contact and increase the number of bank deposits and reduce a cost of a campaign. 



### Data Used
I used the public available data stets available to 
UCI Machine Learning Repository, Bank Marketing Data Set

### Project contents

The project contains two notebooks EDA1 and EDA2 where data preparation is done. I prepared some Exploratory Data Analysis containing:
1. Descriptive statistics
2. Outliers removal
3. Feature selection.

Since project contains both categorical and numerical data the standardisation and transformation data from categories into numeric values was done.

The third notebook: *ML training* contains comparison of different classification algorithms. The optimisation within an algorithm also was made.

### Algorithms used

We have used the following algorithms: 
1. K Nearest Neighborers
2. Naive Bayes
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Logistic Regression
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forest


### Summary

The  most effective algorithm has the accuracy more than  92%.


Future improvements: to add new algorithms and perform more systematic hyperparameter tuning for all models. 

*This is version 0.9.1 from 7 January 2021.*
